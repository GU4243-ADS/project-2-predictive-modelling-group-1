# Project 1: 
### Output folder

This folder contains preprocessed features, models, predictions for baseline model and final advanced model. The main file in /doc will dump intermediary results in this folder.

The /additionals folder documents the results bag of word csv files and CNN model, although we did not choose them as part of the advanced model.
